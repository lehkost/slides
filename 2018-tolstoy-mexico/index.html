## The Tolstoy Project

<br />
- cooperation between [Tolstoy Museum](http://tolstoymuseum.ru/) and Higher School of Economics, Moscow
- digital edition of collected works in 90 volumes, published between 1928 and 1958: novels, short stories, plays, letters, diaries,¬†‚Ä¶ (~ 46,000 pages)
- ["All of Tolstoy in One Click"](http://tolstoy.ru/projects/tolstoy-in-one-click/): all volumes scanned and OCRed (supported by ABBYY)
- corrections were crowdsourced
- abundant media coverage: [New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/crowdsourcing-tolstoy), [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/oct/16/all-leo-tolstoy-one-click-project-digitisation), etc.
- texts available in PDF, EPUB, FB2, MOBI and XHTML (see http://tolstoy.ru/creativity/90-volume-collection-of-the-works/)
- also converted to basic TEI
- next stage: richer markup, onthologies, linked open data

## The 91st Volume ‚Äì A New Perspective

![91st volume (cover)](images/91st-volume-cover.jpg)<!-- .element width="160px;" -->

- supplement volume containing indexes of works and proper names (fiction and non-fiction works like diaries, letters)
- 16,256 registered entries
- web app: http://index.tolstoy.ru/
- target audience: specialists as well as enthusiasts
- general question: even with digitised full texts at hand, how can we benefit from the structuring and registration efforts of the past?

## The Web App

![web app statistics](images/webapp-statistics.png)<!-- .element width="800px;" -->

<small>brown: number of references in the text ‚Äì beige: number of mentions in the comments</small>

---

## Level 1: <br />Enhanced Searches (1/2)

<br />
- original index functionality retained: mapping proper names to volumes and pages
- one-click direct jumps to pages
- added functionality:
  - fuzzy searches: entering "ava" will list results like "Poltava", "Bavari√¢", "Abdulla-al'-Mamun Zuravardi"
  - word-cloud representation conveys a first idea about most frequent words in the corpus

## Level 2: <br />Studying Life and Works of Leo Tolstoy by Means of Network Analysis (2/3)

<br />
- studying co-occurrences of proper names in the same environment (in our case, on the same page) help to understand larger contexts
- example:
  - the Hindu scripture "Bhagavad Gita" is found on 5 pages in Tolstoy's Complete Works, see http://index.tolstoy.ru/person/2138/
  - it shares these five pages with a total of 43 other names mentioned
  - the proximity of these mentionings is not accidental, in our case they form a kind of "Indian cluster" containing works like "Hitopadesha", "Dhammapada", "Vamana Purana", or names like Sri Ramakrishna Paramahansa
  - for Tolstoy, these titles and names are part of a set of carriers of philosophical knowledge, and are associated with names like Xenophon, Montaigne, Montesquieu, Pascal, Skovoroda, Socrates
  - these networks provide great opportunities for understanding the whole range of Tolstoy's interests and ideas

Cf. Woody Allen: "I took a speed reading course where you run your finger down the middle of the page and was able to read 'War and Peace' in twenty minutes. **It's about Russia.**"

## Level 3: <br />Editorial Evolution of the "Complete Works"

<br />
- a quantification of index properties also gives us insights in the editorial process that lasted more than 3 decades
- the "91st Volume" can show how editorial principles have changed over time, especially in regard of the depth of commenting
- e.g., the 13th volume with draft editions of "War and Peace" has a weak commentary, while the 47th volume (diaries and notebooks) has the most detailed commentary among all 90 volumes

---

## Summary

<br />
- making indexes machine-readable is an additional way to research the Collected Works of single authors or similar printed text collections that come with rich and detailed indexes
- functionalities of traditional indexes are not only retained, but also enhanced (fuzzy searches, visualisations of co-occurrences, etc.)
- the Tolstoy web app can serve as a suggestion to apply this method to the Collected Works of other authors
