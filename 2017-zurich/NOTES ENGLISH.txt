DARIAH-EU is a European research infrastructure for the Arts and Humanities. It is a technological platfrom and social network that helps Humanists and the digital aspects of their research. Everybody workd digitally nowadays. But not everybody has to be a digital humanist. But we want to help everybody. They do not have to be interested in infrastructure. But we want to provide them tools and services, so they can get their work done.

If you wonder what an infrastructure for the Humanities is, think of libraries. They are our oldest infrastructure. And they keep being important, of course. But we need a new kind of infrastructure for the digital aspects of our research.

DH is not a new phenomenon. There was an interest in it since at least the middle of the last century.

But the interest has grown. Digital research infrastructures are needed because of the impressive growth of DH, which will continue for a long time, I think.
