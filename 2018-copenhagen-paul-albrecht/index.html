# Chapter 1.

<br />
### Plagiarism: Terminology

--

### "Literary history is and has always been a case of plagiarism, and no court in the world can do anything about it."

<br /><br />
Philipp Theisohn: *Plagiat. Eine unoriginelle <br />Literaturgeschichte.* Stuttgart: KrÃ¶ner 2009, p. 9.

--

## Theisohn's Theses

<br />
1. it always takes three to establish a case of plagiarism: the plagiarised, the plagiariser, the public;
2. plagiarisms occur when we tell each other about them ("A&nbsp;plagiarism that nobody notices isn't one.");
3. plagiarisms "generally negotiate an 'inner' relationship between text and author".

<br />
Ibid., p. 3.

--

## 18th Century? Plagiarism?

<br />
- for their understanding, cases of plagiarism always need their historical, legal and national context (ibid., p. 30)
- Theisohn traces plagarism back to antiquity (e.g., Aristophanes vs. Eupolis)
- in Roman times, an adoption or replication of a Greek model was not regarded as plagiarism (ibid., p. 73)
- copyright as legal concept invented after advent of the printing press (early 18th century)

--

## What, Then, Is so Bad about Plagiarism?

<br />
- well, "someone has consciously deceived us in regard to his poetic ability" (ibid., p. XII)
- consequences? Holberg, Lessing et al. no cases for a court of law
- worst case: negative re-evaluation of their role in literary history and their positioning in the canon
- defence strategy: claiming the "geniuses' right of conquest"
- "hÃ¶heres Abschreiben" ("higher copying", Thomas Mann)

--

## Outlook

<br />
- in 2009, Theisohn announced "new digital plagiarism narratives" (ibid., p. 538)
- increased attention to the topic after 2010: collaborative platforms, some resigning politicians, etc.
- today: neural nets, word embeddings, etc., with use cases pro and contra plagiarism
- until now, these new technologies have been appraised, but novel forms of plagiarism allegations are around the corner, wait for it

# Chapter 2.

<br />
### Paul Albrecht

## Paul Albrecht (1851â€“1894)

## Paul Albrecht (1851â€“1894)

<br />
- born in Hamburg, private school, three years in Manchester (merchant)
- studied medicine in Jena, Berlin, Vienna, Kiel
- prosector and university lecturer in KÃ¶nigsberg
- two doctoral theses (medicine and theology)
- Albrecht was a mega erudite and polyglot (20+ languages)
- when appointed professor ("KÃ¶nigl.-preuÃŸ. Professor") in 1883, he left his position and returned to Hamburg to concentrate on his scientific publications
- and then â€¦
- â€¦ he tried to take down Gotthold Ephraim Lessing<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

# Chapter 3.

<br />
## "Leszing's Plagiate"

--

## Lessing: Refresher (1)

--

## Lessing: Refresher (2)

<br />
- fables and epigrams
- 12 plays (*Miss Sara Sampson*, *Minna von Barnhelm*, *Emilia Galotti*, *Nathan der Weise*, â€¦)
- *Laocoon: or, The limits of Poetry and Painting* (1766)
- *Hamburgische Dramaturgie* (1767â€“1769)
- *The Education of the Human Race* (1780)
- â€¦

And then, more than 100 years after his death â€¦

### Paul Albrecht Vs. Literary History

--

## "Leszing's Plagiate" â€“ The Project (1)

<br />
- 10 volumes planned, 6 published (1890â€“1891, ~ 2.500 pages)
- thesis: Lessing's main business was to maintain a huge collection of excerpts, which he then assembled to new works
- "der ganze Leszing", all his poems as well as plays, "plagiarised and stolen from a to z"
- as a doctor, Albrecht diagnosed Lessing with "**literary kleptomania**", his abundant collection of plagarisms as proof
- some fine intellectual arrogance: Albrecht has a tendency to swear and insult his object of study: "O, du Dieb aller Diebe!" (p. 1566), "o&nbsp;du Urdieb!" (p. 1874), "O, du trauriger LÃ¼gner!" (p. 2128), "du Gauch" (p. 2150), â€¦

--

## "Leszing's Plagiate" â€“ The Project (2)

<br />
- after volume 6 (1891), Albrecht went mad and took his own life in 1894
- tragic end of an otherwise exceptional scholar
- his project was later mocked by philologists, although he unravelled many sources of Lessing

---

# Chapter 4.

<br />
## Holberg in the Crosshairs

--

## While He's at It â€¦

<br />
- GrÃ¼nderzeit era, nationalist arguments: "Leszing is not a German poet at all, he is a thief of Arabic, Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Italian, Spanish, French, Swiss, Belgian, Dutch, English and **Danish** thoughts and ideas."
- actually, Albrecht just wants to show that Lessing also copied from Holberg, but while he's at it â€¦

<small>*Leszing's Plagiate*, vol. 2, p. 588.</small>

--

## Paul Albrecht on Holberg's Plagiarism

<br />
- almost 70 pages of "proof" against Holberg the plagiariser, 33&nbsp;plays analysed
- Paul Albrecht: Plagiatanalyse von v. Holberg's dramatischen Werken. In: *Leszing's Plagiate*, vol. 2, pp. 587â€“654.
- download: &nbsp;**[goo.gl/121wGL](https://goo.gl/121wGL)**&nbsp; (PDF; 33.4 MB)
- result: "Holberg was the clumsier, more brutal, Leszing the finer, smarter thief." (p. 588)

## Albrecht on "Den politiske kandestÃ¸ber"

![Albrecht on "Den politiske kandestÃ¸ber"](images/albrecht-on-politiske-kandestober.jpg)<!-- .element height="480px;" -->

<small>*Leszing's Plagiate*, vol. 2, pp. 589â€“590. </small>

# Chapter 5.

<br />
## Conclusions

--

## Conclusions

<br />
- Albrecht's motivation unclear, especially since he starts his study by acknowledging (and itemising) 17 authors who before Shakespeare used the famous phrase "All the world's a stage" â€“ so he should have known that what-so-ever plagiarism is a driving force of literature
- unsurpassed work on terminology, defines different types of plagiarism: Orthoplagiat, Paraplagiat, Stenoplagiat, dikrenisches Plagiat, Euryplagiat, â€¦ â€“ unfortunately, the glossary was never printed due to his early death and no one seems to have adapted his terminology
- even if the work is > 125 years old: new (non-judgmental) insights into Holberg's sources?
